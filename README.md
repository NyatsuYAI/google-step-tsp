## Problem Statement

In this assignment, you will design an algorithm to solve a fundamental problem
faced by every travelling salesperson, called _Travelling Salesman Problem_
(TSP). Iâ€™ll explain TSP in the onsite class. TSP is very famous problem. See
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem). You can
understand the problem without any difficulties.

Quoted from
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem):

> The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question: Given a
> list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the
> shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the
> origin city?

## what I do

coding [my_ans.py](/my_ans.py), [my_ans_min.py](/my_ans_min.py) and [my_ans_random.py](my_ans_random.py)

## Code 

#### my_ans.py

Why is it not enough to choose the closest distance? I was curious if I changed the first point and if the matching would change. Starting from all points, the distance is put into the Index and the closest distance is returned. This time this was also the first easy one I made, but unfortunately it gave the best score.

#### my_ans_random.py

I heard that when calculating page rank, Google skip to random notes with a certain probability. What would happen if we skip to a random one? This program, based on my_ans.py, has a 15% chance of skipping somewhere. The result was terrible.

#### my_ans_min.py

This is my tried and true program to produce the closest distance. Finally, based on solver_greedy.py, I thought to solve it using 2-pot.
